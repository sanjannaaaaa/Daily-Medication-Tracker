        <h2>Precautions for Brain Health</h2>
        <p>Maintaining brain health is crucial for overall well-being. Here are some precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engage in regular physical exercise to promote blood flow to the brain and enhance cognitive function.</li>
            <li>Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids to support brain health.</li>
            <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption, as these can impair cognitive function and increase the risk of neurological disorders.</li>
            <li>Protect your head from injury by wearing helmets during sports activities and seat belts while driving.</li>
            <li>Stay mentally active by challenging your brain with puzzles, games, reading, and learning new skills.</li>
            <li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness.</li>
            <li>Get adequate sleep to support brain function and memory consolidation.</li>
            <li>Stay socially connected and maintain strong relationships, as social interaction can help prevent cognitive decline.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Medications: Prescription medications may be used to manage symptoms of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, or depression.</li>
            <li>Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy can help improve cognitive function, speech, mobility, and daily living skills.</li>
            <li>Surgery: In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to treat brain tumors, remove blood clots, or relieve pressure on the brain caused by conditions such as hydrocephalus.</li>
            <li>Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation programs may be recommended to help individuals recover from brain injuries or strokes and regain lost skills and independence.</li>
